    <h2>Description</h2>

    Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, 2 Â½ tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Transfer dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip.</li>
    </ol>
