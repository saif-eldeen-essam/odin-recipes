    <h2>Description</h2>

    Lasagna is the name of one of the lidest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangliar or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants.


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
